                          and games and/or live animal shows.

                          to fine dining establishments. They fall into the Dining category if they
                          primarily prepare food and drinks for immediate consumption on the premises
                          or for take-out. Dining merchants include bars, cocktail lounges, nightclubs,
                          taverns and fast-food restaurants. Some merchants that sell food and drinks
                          are located within larger establishments that sell other goods and services
                          and may not be not included in this category. For example a department store
                          or hotel restaurant, theme park cafes or discount store food counter would
                          not be categorized under Dining.
